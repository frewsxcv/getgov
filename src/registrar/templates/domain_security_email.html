  <h1>Domain security email</h1>

  <p>We strongly recommend that you provide a security email. This email will allow the  public to report observed or suspected security issues on your domain. Security emails are made public and included in the <a href="{% public_site_url 'about/data/' %}">.gov domain data</a> we provide.</p>

  <p>A security contact should be capable of evaluating or triaging security reports for your entire domain. Use a team email address, not an individualâ€™s email. We recommend using an alias, like security@domain.gov.</p>
