    Manage the lifecycle of domain names.

    The registry is the source of truth for this data and this model exists:
        1. To tie ownership information in the registrar to
           DNS entries in the registry

    ~~~ HOW TO USE THIS CLASS ~~~

    A) You can create a Domain object with just a name. `Domain(name="something.gov")`.
    B) Saving the Domain object will not contact the registry, as it may be useful
       to have Domain objects in an `UNKNOWN` pre-created state.
    C) Domain properties are lazily loaded. Accessing `my_domain.expiration_date` will
       contact the registry, if a cached copy does not exist.
    D) Domain creation is lazy. If `my_domain.expiration_date` finds that `my_domain`
       does not exist in the registry, it will ask the registry to create it.
    F) Created is _not_ the same as active aka live on the internet.
    G) Activation is controlled by the registry. It will happen automatically when the
       domain meets the required checks.
